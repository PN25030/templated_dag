Apologies for the earlier confusion. Based on the latest Dataplex documentation, you can define data quality rules in a YAML file and reference it when creating a data quality scan. Here's how you can set up a YAML configuration file to perform a null check on a specific column in your BigQuery table.

**1. Create the YAML Configuration File**

Save the following content into a file named `rules.yaml`:

```yaml
rules:
  - column: YOUR_COLUMN_NAME
    nonNullExpectation: {}
    threshold: 1.0
```

**Explanation:**

- `rules`: A list of data quality rules to apply.
  - `column`: The name of the column you want to check for null values.
  - `nonNullExpectation`: An expectation that the column should not contain null values.
  - `threshold`: The acceptable ratio of non-null values. A value of `1.0` means 100% of the values must be non-null for the rule to pass.

**2. Create the Data Quality Scan Using the YAML File**

Use the `gcloud` command-line tool to create a data quality scan that references your YAML configuration:

```sh
gcloud dataplex datascans create data-quality my-bq-null-check-scan \
  --location=us-central1 \
  --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  --data-source=bigquery:projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/datasets/YOUR_DATASET/tables/YOUR_TABLE \
  --display-name="Null Check Scan" \
  --description="Dataplex data quality scan for null check on a column" \
  --rules-file=rules.yaml \
  --schedule="every 24 hours"
```

**Important Notes:**

- **Permissions:** Ensure that the Dataplex service account has the necessary permissions to access the BigQuery table. If the table and the scan are in different projects, grant the Dataplex service account read access to the BigQuery table.

- **Service Account Creation:** If you haven't created the Dataplex service account yet, you can do so with:

  ```sh
  gcloud beta services identity create --service=dataplex.googleapis.com
  ```

  This command returns the Dataplex service account identifier if it exists.

**3. Execute the Data Quality Scan**

To run the scan immediately:

```sh
gcloud dataplex datascans run my-bq-null-check-scan \
  --location=us-central1 \
  --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

**4. View the Scan Results**

After execution, you can view the results:

```sh
gcloud dataplex datascans describe my-bq-null-check-scan \
  --location=us-central1 \
  --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

This command provides details about the scan, including its status and any data quality issues detected.
