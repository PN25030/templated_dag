# Proof of Concept (POC) Documentation  
## BigQuery and KMS Key Integration Using Terraform

### 1. Objective  
This POC aims to demonstrate Terraform’s capability to create a BigQuery dataset and table, then apply a KMS key to the table. It will serve as a feasibility study for managing Google Cloud resources using Terraform.

### 2. Scope  
- Use Terraform to provision Google Cloud resources, specifically BigQuery and KMS.
- Test the automation of encryption setup on BigQuery tables with KMS keys.
- This POC focuses on Terraform configuration, setup, and application of resources.

### 3. Prerequisites  
- Google Cloud Project with BigQuery and KMS API enabled.
- Appropriate Google Cloud IAM roles for Terraform to manage BigQuery datasets, tables, and KMS resources.
- Terraform CLI installed and configured for Google Cloud access.

### 4. Architecture Overview  
- BigQuery Dataset and Table creation.
- Google Cloud KMS Key setup.
- Application of KMS encryption to the BigQuery table via Terraform.
  
*(Optional) Include a simple architecture diagram to illustrate resource relationships.*

### 5. Steps

#### 5.1 Terraform Configuration  
- Define the provider configuration for Google Cloud in Terraform.
    ```hcl
    provider "google" {
      project = "<PROJECT_ID>"
      region  = "<REGION>"
    }
    ```

#### 5.2 BigQuery Dataset and Table Creation  
- Create configurations for the BigQuery dataset and table:
    ```hcl
    resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "example_dataset" {
      dataset_id = "<DATASET_ID>"
      location   = "<LOCATION>"
    }

    resource "google_bigquery_table" "example_table" {
      dataset_id = google_bigquery_dataset.example_dataset.dataset_id
      table_id   = "<TABLE_ID>"
      schema     = "<SCHEMA_JSON>"
    }
    ```

#### 5.3 KMS Keyring and Key Creation  
- Define resources for the KMS keyring and key:
    ```hcl
    resource "google_kms_key_ring" "example_keyring" {
      name     = "<KEYRING_NAME>"
      location = "<LOCATION>"
    }

    resource "google_kms_crypto_key" "example_key" {
      name            = "<KEY_NAME>"
      key_ring        = google_kms_key_ring.example_keyring.id
      purpose         = "ENCRYPT_DECRYPT"
    }
    ```

#### 5.4 Apply KMS Key to BigQuery Table  
- Configure the BigQuery table to use the KMS key for encryption:
    ```hcl
    resource "google_bigquery_table" "example_table" {
      dataset_id              = google_bigquery_dataset.example_dataset.dataset_id
      table_id                = "<TABLE_ID>"
      schema                  = "<SCHEMA_JSON>"
      encryption_configuration {
        kms_key_name = google_kms_crypto_key.example_key.id
      }
    }
    ```

### 6. Validation and Testing  
- Validate the resources created in Google Cloud Console.
- Verify that the BigQuery table has encryption enabled and is using the specified KMS key.
- Confirm Terraform’s ability to modify, delete, and reapply configurations for these resources.

### 7. Results  
- Summarize any key metrics, outcomes, or performance observations.
- Note any limitations or challenges encountered during the POC.

### 8. Recommendations  
- **If Successful**: Propose steps to transition the setup for a production environment, such as additional testing or security configurations.
- **If Not Successful**: Document issues and suggest modifications or alternatives.

### 9. Next Steps  
- Outline potential next actions or further experiments based on the findings.
