# Proof of Concept (POC) Documentation  
## BigQuery Dataset and Table with KMS Key Integration

### 1. Objective  
This POC aims to demonstrate the feasibility of creating a BigQuery dataset and table, then encrypting the table using a Google Cloud KMS key.  

### 2. Scope  
- Creation of a BigQuery dataset and table.
- Generation of a KMS key.
- Application of KMS key to secure the BigQuery table.

### 3. Prerequisites  
- Google Cloud Project with BigQuery and KMS API enabled.
- Appropriate permissions for dataset creation, table management, and KMS key administration.

### 4. Steps

#### 4.1 BigQuery Dataset Creation  
- Create a dataset in BigQuery using the following configurations:  
  - **Dataset ID**: [Provide ID]
  - **Location**: [Specify location]
  - **Description**: [Brief description]

#### 4.2 BigQuery Table Creation  
- Define and create a BigQuery table within the dataset:
  - **Table ID**: [Provide ID]
  - **Schema**: [Specify schema, e.g., name: STRING, age: INTEGER]
  - **Data Retention**: [Retention details if applicable]

#### 4.3 KMS Key Creation  
- Generate a KMS key with the following specifications:
  - **Keyring ID**: [Provide ID]
  - **Key ID**: [Provide ID]
  - **Key Purpose**: Encrypt/decrypt data in BigQuery

#### 4.4 Apply KMS Key to BigQuery Table  
- Attach the generated KMS key to the BigQuery table by setting the `encryptionConfiguration` on the table.

### 5. Validation and Testing  
- Verify that the KMS key is applied by inspecting the encryption configuration of the BigQuery table.
- Test the encryption by querying data in the table to ensure that permissions are managed correctly.

### 6. Outcomes and Findings  
- Briefly summarize any findings, challenges encountered, or learnings from the POC.

### 7. Next Steps  
- **If Successful**: [Indicate steps for production implementation or further testing]
- **If Not Successful**: [Document potential issues and next steps for troubleshooting]
