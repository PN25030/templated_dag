The **best approach** to update the variable values dynamically based on the environment (`uat`, `prod`, `dev`) depends on the balance of **ease of management**, **scalability**, and **clarity**. Below is a combination of the **workspaces approach** and **environment-specific variable files** to provide flexibility while maintaining clarity.

### Recommended Approach: Combining Workspaces with Environment-Specific `.tfvars` Files

This approach uses **workspaces** to logically separate environments (`dev`, `uat`, `prod`) while loading environment-specific variable files to handle configuration differences. This method leverages Terraform's native workspace functionality, but also allows you to explicitly control environment configurations using `.tfvars` files for added flexibility.

### Steps to Implement

#### 1. **Single `main.tf`**
Your `main.tf` will stay the same for all environments, using variable inputs.

```hcl
# main.tf

provider "google" {
  project = var.project_id
  region  = "us-central1"
}

module "bigquery" {
  source      = "./modules/bigquery"
  project_id  = var.project_id
  dataset_id  = var.dataset_id
  table_id    = var.table_id
  location    = var.location
  labels      = var.labels
  schema_file = var.schema_file
}
```

#### 2. **Define Variables (`variables.tf`)**
This defines the variables that will differ across environments.

```hcl
# variables.tf

variable "project_id" {
  description = "GCP Project ID"
  type        = string
}

variable "dataset_id" {
  description = "BigQuery Dataset ID"
  type        = string
}

variable "table_id" {
  description = "BigQuery Table ID"
  type        = string
}

variable "location" {
  description = "BigQuery Dataset location"
  type        = string
  default     = "US"
}

variable "labels" {
  description = "Labels for BigQuery dataset and table"
  type        = map(string)
  default     = {}
}

variable "schema_file" {
  description = "Path to BigQuery table schema"
  type        = string
}
```

#### 3. **Create `.tfvars` Files for Each Environment**

Use `.tfvars` files to define environment-specific values. These files allow you to manage the different configurations for each environment (`dev`, `uat`, `prod`) in a separate, clearly defined manner.

```hcl
# dev.tfvars
project_id  = "dev-project-id"
dataset_id  = "dev_dataset"
table_id    = "dev_table"
location    = "US"
schema_file = "schema/dev_schema.json"
labels = {
  environment = "dev"
  owner       = "team-dev"
}

# uat.tfvars
project_id  = "uat-project-id"
dataset_id  = "uat_dataset"
table_id    = "uat_table"
location    = "US"
schema_file = "schema/uat_schema.json"
labels = {
  environment = "uat"
  owner       = "team-uat"
}

# prod.tfvars
project_id  = "prod-project-id"
dataset_id  = "prod_dataset"
table_id    = "prod_table"
location    = "US"
schema_file = "schema/prod_schema.json"
labels = {
  environment = "prod"
  owner       = "team-prod"
}
```

#### 4. **Use Terraform Workspaces**
Workspaces provide logical isolation for each environment without needing multiple directories or `main.tf` files.

- **Create workspaces** for each environment:
  
  ```bash
  terraform workspace new dev
  terraform workspace new uat
  terraform workspace new prod
  ```

- **Switch to the desired workspace** when deploying or managing infrastructure:

  ```bash
  terraform workspace select dev
  terraform apply -var-file="dev.tfvars"

  terraform workspace select uat
  terraform apply -var-file="uat.tfvars"

  terraform workspace select prod
  terraform apply -var-file="prod.tfvars"
  ```

---

### Why This Approach Works Best

1. **Simplicity**: You maintain a **single `main.tf`** file, reducing complexity. Workspaces and `.tfvars` files handle the differences between environments.

2. **Environment Isolation**: Workspaces create **separation** of state, so changes in `dev` wonâ€™t affect `prod`. This isolation reduces risk and makes testing easier.

3. **Explicit Environment Variables**: `.tfvars` files make it **clear** which variables are used in each environment, and you can easily version-control these files for transparency.

4. **Scalability**: As new environments are needed, you can simply add a new `.tfvars` file and create a corresponding workspace. This scales easily without modifying the core Terraform code.

5. **Flexibility**: You have the option to explicitly switch workspaces and see which one you're in, while controlling environment-specific variable configurations.

### Additional Tips

- **Lock Versions**: Use a `versions.tf` to lock down your provider versions and ensure consistent deployment across environments.
  
    ```hcl
    terraform {
      required_providers {
        google = {
          source  = "hashicorp/google"
          version = "~> 4.0"
        }
      }
      required_version = ">= 1.0.0"
    }
    ```

- **State Management**: Make sure your state is appropriately managed. You could use a remote backend (e.g., Terraform Cloud, Google Cloud Storage) to store state for each workspace.

- **Automate Deployment**: You can further automate this approach using CI/CD pipelines where each environment can be deployed based on specific branches (e.g., deploy to `prod` on the `main` branch, `dev` on the `develop` branch).

Would you like to explore automating this with a CI/CD tool, or any other aspect in more detail?
